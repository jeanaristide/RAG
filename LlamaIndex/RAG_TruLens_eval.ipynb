He shares his thoughts on why he has been drawn to unprestigious types of work, such as still life painting and working on things that weren't prestigious at the time, like Viaweb and Y Combinator. He also talks about how he has learned to choose his projects based on his own motivations and not just to impress others. Additionally, the essay touches on his personal experiences with starting a family, falling in love, and his thoughts on angel investing.

He writes that he has always been drawn to things that weren't prestigious, such as still life painting, Viaweb, Y Combinator, and angel investing. He argues that this choice has led him to discover something real and to have the right kind of motives, rather than being driven by a desire to impress people. The author also shares personal anecdotes and experiences, such as his time-sharing machines with interactive OSes, Italian words for abstract concepts, and his signature style seekers at RISD. Overall, the essay provides a unique perspective on life and work, and how one can find fulfillment and success by doing what they are passionate about, rather than conforming to societal expectations.\"   \n",
